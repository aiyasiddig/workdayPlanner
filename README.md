# workdayPlanner
This workday planner is created for the standard business hours, 9am-5pm and includes an edit button to allow the user to type in input and save it. The current hour will be colorcoded greeen, past hours will be a light shade of red and future hours are blue. The user input is able to be stored to local storage, however I was not able to figure out how to make the text reappear on the screen when the user refreshes.
